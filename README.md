# Sentiment-analysis-of-movie-reviews

The SentimentClassifier_POS repository contains the code which uses the Stanford Part of Speech(POS) tagger to tag each word with its precise part of speech. 
This information is then used to lookup for the score of the word in SentiWordNet dictionary, finally calculating the final positivity/negativity score of the entire text.
Based on this score, the review is classified as having either a positive or a negative sentiment.
